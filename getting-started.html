    <h3>Setting Up a PHP Environment</h3>
    <p>To start developing with PHP, you need a server environment that can interpret PHP code. Here are some popular options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>XAMPP</strong> - Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, XAMPP includes Apache, PHP, and MySQL, making it a great all-in-one solution.</li>
      <li><strong>WAMP</strong> - A similar solution for Windows users.</li>
      <li><strong>MAMP</strong> - A package available for macOS users.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you've installed a server environment, place your PHP files in the server's root directory (e.g., <code>htdocs</code> for XAMPP) and access them through <code>http://localhost/filename.php</code> in your browser.</p>

    <h3>Your First PHP Script</h3>
    <p>Letâ€™s create a simple "Hello, World!" script to ensure your PHP environment is set up correctly:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
echo "Hello, World!";
?&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>Save this code in a file named <code>hello.php</code> and place it in your server's root directory. Then, open your browser and go to <code>http://localhost/hello.php</code> to see your output.</p>

    <h3>How PHP Works</h3>
    <p>When you access a PHP page, the server processes the PHP code and returns the result as plain HTML to the browser. This allows you to build dynamic and interactive web pages efficiently.</p>
